# How to get an OEC

> :warning: This is a work in progress. guide will be updated as I find more information.

To leave the Philippines as a Filipino with work abroad, you need an OEC (Overseas Employment Certificate). It's very difficult to get one, so I've documented every step of the process I took for the benefit of others.

This document outlines how you can get one as a skilled worker. This guide mostly assumes:

- You are a direct hire (no recruitment agency).
- You already have a working visa abroad.
- You already have an employer abroad.
