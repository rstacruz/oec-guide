# How to get an OEC

> :warning: This is a work in progress. guide will be updated as I find more information.

To leave the Philippines as a Filipino with work abroad, you'll need an OEC (Overseas Employment Certificate). It's very difficult to get one. I've documented every step of the process I took for the benefit of others.

## What's an OEC?

An OEC is your exit clearance out of the Philippines. If you have a work visa abroad, the Bureau of Immigration in Philippine airports will not let you leave the Philippines without an OEC.

> The Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC) is a requirement under the rules and regulations of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) to help ensure that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are properly documented and protected.

Here's a sample OEC from 2014:

## How do you get one?

If you're abroad, I think you use [bmonline.ph](http://www.bmonline.ph/). For those in the Philippines, it involves visits to the POEA office in EDSA, and a lot of paperwork. Read on!

## Assumptions

This document outlines how you can get an OEC as a direct hire. This guide mostly assumes:

- You don't have a recruitment agency.
- You already have a working visa abroad.
- You already have an employer abroad.
- You are in the Philippines.
