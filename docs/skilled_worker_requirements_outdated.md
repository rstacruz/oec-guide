# Skilled workers requirements list (outdated)

> **Update:** As of June 2018, a more updated version is now online as part of [Advisory No. 33 Series of 2018](http://www.poea.gov.ph/advisories/2018/Advisory-33-2018.pdf). This page is only here for historical purposes.

Thte POEA has an outdated a list of requirements for skilled worker requirements list. **This no longer valid** as of May 27th of 2018. It's still listed as the latest requirements in the website, but a new list of requirements is available from the Direct Hire department of the POEA offices.

## Fees

These were the fees listed in this document:

> - **USD \$100** (or PHP equivalent) for POEA processing fee
> - **USD \$25** (or PHP equivalent) for OWWA membership fee

This is most likely no longer valid, either. The new document doesn't have a list of fees.
