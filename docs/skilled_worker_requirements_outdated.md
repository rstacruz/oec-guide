Thte POEA has an outdated a list of requirements for skilled worker requirements list. **This no longer valid** as of May 27th of 2018. It's still listed as the latest requirements in the website, but a new list of requirements is available from the Direct Hire department of the POEA offices.

## Fees

These were the fees listed in this document:
