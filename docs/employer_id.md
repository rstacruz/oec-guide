# _POLO contract verification_ Employer ID

An employer's ID is required by both POLO and POEA for 2 different processes.

- It's required by the POLO for [contract verification](./contract.md).

- It's required by the POEA as an attachment to your [Notarized statement](./notarized_statement.md).

## Citation

The POEA requires this as part of its POEA direct hire evaluation requirements:

> "Notarized statement on how the worker secured his/her employment, with attached photocopy of employer's passport/ID and contact details"
>
> *&mdash; from [POEA direct hire evaluation requirements](./evaluation_requirements.md), page 1*

The POLO requires this as part of the requirements to be submitted for contract verification:

> "5. copy of employers passport or drivers license"
>
> *&mdash; from an email correspondence with POLO, Canberra, Australia, dated May 29, 2018*

## Exemptions

This may or may not be required. For instance, [Japan](http://polotokyo.dole.gov.ph/issuance-of-balik-manggawa/) only requires it if you are working for an individual, and not a company. Check with your POLO to confirm if this will be needed.

## To do

- <input type='checkbox'> Ask for an ID from your employer.

- <input type='checkbox'> Pass it onto POLO as part of the requirements they ask for a contract verification.

- <input type='checkbox'> When submitting your [notarized statement](./notarized_statement.md) for notarization, attach a copy of their ID.
