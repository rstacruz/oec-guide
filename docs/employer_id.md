# _POLO contract verification_ Employer ID

> TODO: I'm still researching this.

## What for

The employer's ID is required for 2 processes:

- Required by the POLO for [contract verification](./contract.md).

- Required by the POEA as an attachment to your [Notarized statement](./notarized_statement.md).
