# _POLO contract verification_ Employer ID

> TODO: I'm still researching this.

## What for

The employer's ID is required for 2 processes:

- Required by the POLO for [contract verification](./contract.md).

- Required by the POEA as an attachment to your [Notarized statement](./notarized_statement.md).

## Citation

The POEA requires this as part of its POEA direct hire evaluation requirements:

> "Notarized statement on how the worker secured his/her employment, with attached photocopy of employer's passport/ID and contact details"
>
> *&mdash; from [POEA direct hire evaluation requirements](./evaluation_requirements.md), page 1*

The POLO requires this as part of the requirements to be submitted for contract verification:

> "5. copy of employers passport or drivers license"
>
> *&mdash; from an email correspondence with POLO, Canberra, Australia, dated May 29, 2018*
