# _POEA Phase 1 Evaluation_ Notarized statement

You need to issue a statement with details on how you managed to find work abroad. This needs to be notarized along with an ID from your employer. According to the [POEA evaluation requirements](./evaluation_requirements.md), the exact requirement is:

> Notarized statement on how the worker secured his/her employment, with attached photocopy of employer's passport/ID and contact details

This statement will be passed as part of the phase 1 requirements for POEA [direct hire evaluation](./direct_hire_evaluation.md).

> TODO: I'm still inquiring about this.
