# _POEA_ Phase 1 evaluation

**To acquire an OEC, you need to first be evaluated by the Direct Hire department of the POEA offices in EDSA.** To be evaluated, you'll need to submit all the documents in their checklist (phase 1), and attend seminars and medical exams (phase 2).

## May 2018 checklist

As of May 2018, this department issues a checklist of requirements. See: [Evaluation requirements](./evaluation_requirements.md).

:warning: Avoid consulting the POEA website; their checklist [is outdated](./skilled_worker_requirements_outdated.md).
