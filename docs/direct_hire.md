# Direct hires

POEA processes OEC's for **Agency Hires** and **Direct Hires.** If you didn't get your work visa through a recruitment agency, then you're a direct hire.

## Ban on direct hires

Direct hire OEC applications are not processed by the POEA, but exemptions can be granted. See this excerpt from _§123_:

> SECTION 123. Ban on Direct Hires. — No employer shall directly hire an Overseas Filipino Worker for overseas employment.
