# _Introduction_ Direct hires

POEA processes OEC's for **Agency Hires** and **Direct Hires.** If you didn't get your work visa through a recruitment agency, then you're a direct hire.

## Ban on direct hires

Direct hire OEC applications are not processed by the POEA, but exemptions can be granted. See this excerpt from _§123_:

> SECTION 123. Ban on Direct Hires. — No employer shall directly hire an Overseas Filipino Worker for overseas employment.

However, professionals and skilled workers are exempted from the direct hire ban. See this excerpt from _§124(d)(2)_:

> SECTION 124. Exemption from the Ban on Direct Hiring. — The following are exempted from the ban on direct hiring:
>
> ... d. Other employers as may be allowed by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, such as:
>
> ...... Professionals and skilled workers with duly executed/authenticated contracts containing terms and conditions over and above the standards set by the POEA. (...)

## Proving your exemption

To ensure that you're exempted from this ban, you will need an endorsement letter from the Philippine Overseas Labor Office nearest to your workplace abroad. This process is detailed in the next [POLO endorsement](./polo_endorsement.md) section.
