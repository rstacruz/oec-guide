# Correspondences with POLO Australia

I inquired with POLO Australia, here are some of the information they've relayed to me.

## Verification requirements

When I inquired about OEC's and contract verification requirements, here was their reply:

> Yes you need to secure an OEC before departing from the Philippines.
>
> In order for the POEA to issue your OEC you need to present to them your verified and authenticated employment documents.
>
> The following are the requirements for verification and authentication of employment documents by POLO:
>
> 1. employment contract (signed on all pages by the employer and the worker)
> 2. copy of the worker's passport 
> 3. copy of the worker's visa 
> 4. copy of company's business registration
> 5. copy of employers passport or drivers license
> 6. company certification that they have not hired more than 5 Filipino workers processed by POEA and POLO and that the company has not partnered with Philippine Recruitment agency to process the deployment of their workers.
>
> Please submit them through this email and i will advise you of the payment of fees.
>

>
> Kindly secure a POEA Compliance Sheet which should be signed by the employer in order to cover the Philippine requirements that are not covered by the employment contract.

## Contract addendums

I inquired in POEA Mandaluyong on how to secure a POEA Compliance Sheet, and said that they can't issue that unless you have a verified contract. When I told POLO about this, their response was:

> If that's the case you need to let your employer sign the attached Addendum. You can retype to replace your name and the company.
