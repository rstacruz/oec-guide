# Checklist for direct hire evaluation

As of May 27th of 2018, the POEA has a new list of requirements for evaluation. This document is not available online; it's only available in the *Direct Hire* department of the POEA offices in EDSA.

:warning: This list is more updated than the the list you can [find in their website](./skilled_worker_requirements_outdated.md).
