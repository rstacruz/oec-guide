# _POLO contract verification_ Contract addendum

> TODO: I'm still inquiring about this.

## Clauses

An addendum adds provisions that will account for items in the [POEA employment standards](./employment_standards.md) that may not be covered by the original employment contract. These would usually include:

- **Overtime pay** <br>
  in compliance with §135(g) (h)

- **Leave policy** <br>
  in compliance with §135(i)

- **Place of work** <br>
  in compliance with §135(b)

- **Airfare/repatriation provisions** <br> in compliance with §135(m)

- **Termination** <br> in compliance with §135(k)

- **Repatriation of remains** <br> in compliance with §135(n)

- **Settlement of disputes** <br> in compliance with §135(l)

## Sample addendums

- [Addendum Japan contract.pdf](http://www.poea.gov.ph/gbr/2016/Addendum%20Japan%20contract.pdf) _(poea.gov.ph)_ &mdash; This is geared towards household staff, but many of the provisions here should apply for skilled workers as well.

- [GBMLT Standard Employment Contract.pdf](http://www.gbmlt.com.ph/images/templ_obj/accreditation/GBMLT_STANDARD%20EMPLOYMENT%20CONTRACT.pdf) _(gbmlt.com.ph)_ &mdash; A contract addendum for Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia, but most provisions should be applicable to other territories as well.

## Ask your POLO

Your best bet is to email the POLO that will process your documents. Ask for a sample contract addendum. I've personally done this with the POLO in Australia, and they sent a template over.
