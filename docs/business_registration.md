# _POLO contract verification_ Business registration

Your employer's business registration is required by two agencies: the POLO (for [contract verification](./contract.md)) and POEA (for [direct hire evaluation phase 1](./direct_hire_evaluation.md)).

## For Australia

You'll need the Australian Business Number ([ABN]) of your employer. This can be easily found in your employer's letterheads. There's also an [advanced ABN lookup] tool you can use to search by entity, business or trading name.

ONce you have the ABN number, use the Australian Business Registrar's [ABN Lookup] tool to get their business registration details. POLO Australia requests that this be printed out and attached as part of your contract verification:

> "For the company's business registration you can print a copy from the ABN Lookup."

## For other countries

Contact your local POLO for details.
