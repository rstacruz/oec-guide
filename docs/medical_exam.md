# Pr-Employment Medical Examination (PEME)

You need a medical certificate as part of the requirements for obtaining an OEC certificate. This involves a physical examination. This is stipulated in [POEA Memorandum Circular No. 08 of 2018](./memorandum_circular_08.md), section IV.

## Exemptions

You don't need a medical exam if you had one as part of the process of applying for a visa. From section IV, paragraph 2:

> A Direct-Hire OFW may be exempted from PEME if the worker has undergone a medical examination as a requirement for issuance of visa be the country of destination.

## Health facilities

You must go to a "Medical Clinic accredited by the Department of Health (DOH)." See [Health facilities](./health_facilities.md) document for a list of accredited facilities.
